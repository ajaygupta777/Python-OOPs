        "\n",
        "- Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance: A subclass inherits methods from its superclass. This establishes a relationship where the subclass can use the methods defined in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method Overriding: The subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass. This is called method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphic Behavior: When a method is called on an object, Python determines the correct implementation to execute based on the object's actual class. If the object is an instance of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass is executed. If the object is an instance of the superclass, the original method in the superclass is executed."
